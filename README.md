# Microservices Project with Distributed Tracing and Service Discovery -- Spring Boot

This project is a demonstration of building a microservices architecture with various key components for managing distributed systems effectively. Here's a brief overview of the components used:

## Zipkin - Distributed Tracing 

Zipkin is a distributed tracing system that helps gather and visualize trace data from microservices. It allows us to track requests as they travel through various microservices, providing insights into latency issues, dependencies, and bottlenecks in our system. By integrating Zipkin into our architecture, we gain visibility into the flow of requests and can identify areas for optimization and troubleshooting.

## Config Server

The Config Server is a central component that manages configuration properties for all microservices in our system. It provides a single source of truth for configuration management, allowing us to externalize configuration from our codebase and manage it dynamically. With the Config Server, we can easily update configuration properties across all microservices without redeploying them, enabling better scalability, flexibility, and maintainability of our system.

## Spring Cloud Netflix - Service Registry

Spring Cloud Netflix provides a set of libraries and tools for building microservices-based applications on the Netflix OSS stack. One key component of Spring Cloud Netflix is the Service Registry, which allows microservices to register themselves and discover other services in the system dynamically. By leveraging the Service Registry, we can achieve service discovery and load balancing in a distributed environment, enabling seamless communication between microservices without hardcoding service endpoints.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Configure the Config Server with your desired configuration properties.
3. Run the microservices and register them with the Service Registry.
4. Start Zipkin server to collect and visualize trace data.
5. Access the microservices and observe distributed tracing using Zipkin UI.

## Further Enhancements

- Implement circuit breakers and client-side load balancing with Spring Cloud Netflix components.
- Integrate security features using Spring Security and OAuth2 for securing microservices communication.
- Explore additional observability tools and techniques for monitoring and managing microservices in production environments.
